This cheatsheet provides example queries for analyzing VPC Flow Logs in CloudWatch Logs Insights. These queries help you troubleshoot network issues, identify security threats, and understand traffic patterns.

## Getting Started

1. Open [CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
2. Navigate to **Logs** â†’ **Logs Insights**
3. Select your VPC Flow Logs log group
4. Choose a time range
5. Paste a query and click **Run query**

| filter action = "REJECT"
| stats count() as reject_count by srcaddr, dstaddr, dstport
| sort reject_count desc
```

### Find All Traffic to/from a Specific Network Interface

```
fields @timestamp, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, bytes, action
| filter interface_id = "eni-1234567890abcdef0"
| sort @timestamp desc
```

### Identify Flows with Log Status Issues

```
fields @timestamp, srcaddr, dstaddr, dstport, log_status
| filter log_status != "OK"
| stats count() as error_count by log_status
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Specify time ranges**: Narrow time ranges improve query performance
2. **Use filters early**: Place `filter` commands before `stats` when possible
3. **Limit results**: Use `limit` to reduce data processing
4. **Use specific fields**: Only select fields you need with `fields` command
5. **Aggregate wisely**: Use `stats` to summarize large datasets

## Creating CloudWatch Alarms

You can create alarms based on metric filters. Example metric filter patterns:

### Alert on High Rejected Traffic

Metric filter pattern:
```
[version, account_id, interface_id, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action=REJECT, log_status]
```

### Alert on SSH Brute Force Attempts

Metric filter pattern:
```
[version, account_id, interface_id, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport=22, protocol=6, packets, bytes, start, end, action=REJECT, log_status]
```
